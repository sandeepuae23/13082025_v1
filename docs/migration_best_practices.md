## Advanced Data Type Mapping

### Sophisticated Type Conversion Matrix

| Oracle Type | Elasticsearch Type | Transformation Rules | Performance Impact |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| `VARCHAR2(n)` | `text + keyword` | Auto-analyzer detection, keyword sub-field | Low |
| `NUMBER(p,s)` | `scaled_float` | Precision-aware scaling, null handling | Low |
| `DATE/TIMESTAMP` | `date` | ISO 8601 conversion, timezone normalization | Low |
| `CLOB` | `text` | Size limits, external storage for large content | Medium |
| `BLOB` | `binary` | Base64 encoding, external storage recommendation | High |
| `RAW` | `binary` | Direct binary mapping | Medium |
| `XMLTYPE` | `object` | JSON conversion, nested structure preservation | Medium |

### Dynamic Field Mapping Templates

```json
{
  "dynamic_templates": [
    {
      "dates_by_pattern": {
        "match": "*_date|*_time|*_timestamp",
        "mapping": {
          "type": "date",
          "format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy-MM-dd||epoch_millis"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "ids_as_keywords": {
        "match": "*_id|*_code|*_key",
        "mapping": {
          "type": "keyword"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "amounts_as_scaled_float": {
        "match": "*_amount|*_price|*_cost|*_value",
        "mapping": {
          "type": "scaled_float",
          "scaling_factor": 100
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Batch Processing Optimization

**Optimal Batch Sizes**:
- **Small datasets** (< 1M records): 1,000-5,000 records per batch
- **Medium datasets** (1M-10M records): 5,000-10,000 records per batch  
- **Large datasets** (> 10M records): 10,000-20,000 records per batch
- **Memory constraint**: Keep batch size under 5-15MB

**Parallel Processing Guidelines**:
- **CPU-bound**: Worker count = CPU cores × 1.5
- **I/O-bound**: Worker count = CPU cores × 2-3
- **Network-bound**: Monitor queue sizes and adjust dynamically

### Elasticsearch Index Optimization

**Bulk Loading Settings**:
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_replicas": 0,
    "refresh_interval": "30s",
    "index.translog.durability": "async",
    "index.translog.sync_interval": "30s",
    "index.merge.policy.max_merge_at_once": 30,
    "index.merge.policy.segments_per_tier": 30
  }
}
```

**Post-Migration Settings**:
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_replicas": 1,
    "refresh_interval": "1s",
    "index.translog.durability": "request"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling & Recovery Strategies

### Multi-Layer Error Handling

1. **Connection Level**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
2. **Batch Level**: Failed batch retry with smaller batch sizes
3. **Record Level**: Individual record error handling and dead letter queue
4. **System Level**: Circuit breaker pattern for cascading failure prevention

### Dead Letter Queue Implementation

**Features**:
- Persistent storage of failed records
- Metadata tracking (error reason, timestamp, retry count)
- Batch reprocessing capabilities
- Error pattern analysis for root cause identification

**Recovery Process**:
1. Analyze failed records for patterns
2. Fix underlying issues (mapping, data quality, etc.)
3. Reprocess failed records in controlled batches
4. Validate successful recovery

### Retry Strategies

**Exponential Backoff**:
- Base delay: 1 second
- Maximum delay: 5 minutes
- Jitter: ±10% to prevent thundering herd
- Maximum retries: 3-5 attempts

## Complex Query Translation Examples

### Multi-Table JOIN to Nested Documents

**Oracle Source**:
```sql
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.total_amount,
    c.customer_name,
    c.email,
    c.phone,
    oi.product_id,
    oi.quantity,
    oi.unit_price,
    p.product_name,
    p.category,
    p.description
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE o.order_date >= SYSDATE - 30
```

**Elasticsearch Target Structure**:
```json
{
  "order_id": "ORD-2024-12345",
  "order_date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "total_amount": 1299.99,
  "customer": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-0123"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "PROD-001",
      "product_name": "Premium Widget",
      "category": "Electronics",
      "description": "High-quality electronic widget",
      "quantity": 2,
      "unit_price": 549.99,
      "line_total": 1099.98
    },
    {
      "product_id": "PROD-002",
      "product_name": "Standard Cable",
      "category": "Accessories",
      "description": "Standard connection cable",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unit_price": 200.01,
      "line_total": 200.01
    }
  ],
  "_metadata": {
    "migration_timestamp": "2024-01-20T15:45:00Z",
    "source_system": "Oracle_ERP",
    "record_version": "v1.2"
  }
}
```

### Hierarchical Data Structure Transformation

**Oracle Hierarchical Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    manager_id,
    department_id,
    salary,
    LEVEL as hierarchy_level,
    SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(last_name, '/') as org_path
FROM employees
START WITH manager_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id
ORDER SIBLINGS BY last_name
```

**Elasticsearch Nested Organization Structure**:
```json
{
  "employee_id": "EMP001",
  "personal_info": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@company.com"
  },
  "organizational_info": {
    "department_id": "DEPT001",
    "salary": 85000,
    "hierarchy_level": 1,
    "org_path": "/Smith",
    "manager": null,
    "direct_reports": [
      {
        "employee_id": "EMP002",
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "hierarchy_level": 2,
        "department_id": "DEPT001"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Migration Validation Framework

### Multi-Dimensional Validation

1. **Record Count Validation**
   - Source vs. destination record counts
   - Handling of soft deletes and filters
   - Time-based count comparisons

2. **Data Accuracy Validation**
   - Statistical sampling (typically 1-5% of total records)
   - Field-by-field comparison
   - Hash-based integrity checks

3. **Data Type Validation**
   - Type mapping accuracy
   - Precision and scale validation
   - Date format consistency

4. **Business Logic Validation**
   - Calculated field accuracy
   - Relationship integrity
   - Business rule compliance

### Automated Validation Scoring

**Scoring Criteria**:
- **Record Count Match**: ≥99% = Excellent, ≥95% = Good, <95% = Needs Review
- **Data Accuracy**: ≥98% = Excellent, ≥90% = Good, <90% = Needs Review
- **Type Mapping**: ≥95% = Excellent, ≥85% = Good, <85% = Needs Review
- **Performance**: <5min for 1M records = Excellent, <15min = Good
